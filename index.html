            <p>This fractal generator works by taking several fractal "nodes" and connecting them together into a series of vectors (This series is the "replacer"). Next, a vector is drawn from the first node to the last. This series of vectors (currently just one vector) is the "fractal". Every vector in the fractal is then replaced with the replacer, the only difference being that the replacer is scaled and oriented to have a vector sum equal to that of the original vector. Repeat this process several times, and an actual fractal will form. At least three fractal nodes are required to create a fractal. <strong>Put your mouse over the label for each setting for additional information on what it does.</strong></p>
